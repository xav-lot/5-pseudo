# 📖 Implement a CSS Tooltip

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I want to hover over terms or phrases and read short info on them instead of having that info directly on the page.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when certain terms and phrases are underlined and change the cursor to a hand icon when the user hovers over them.

* It's done when the user hovers over the term or phrase and a rectangular tooltip appears next to it.

* It's done when the tooltip has the same background color and text color as the header and navbar items.

## 📝 Notes

## 💡 Hints

* Feel free to choose which terms or phrases from the given text you want to apply the tooltip to! For example, if the phrase I want to emphasize is "Cascading Style Sheets," the tooltip could say, "Commonly known as CSS."

* How can we use the `::after` pseudo-element along with the `:hover` selector to create the tooltip?

* How can you designate the keyword to use a `data-descr` custom data attribute for the tooltip text?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner:

* What are some real-life scenarios for using pseudo-elements?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
